# Twitter-Redesign

 This is part of the Microverse RoR course capstone project. In this project, I was given a template to redesign the twitter web page. The project is required to have a similar look on the color, style, and basic functionality. In this app you can:
 - create an account and log in. Once you are logged in you can tweet and see other users tweet also.
 - You can follow any user, and the user can follow you.
 - You can upload a profile photo and cover photo, if not default is shown.
